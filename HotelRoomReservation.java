Design a program that allows users to make hotel room reservations, view 
availability, and manage bookings.

To design a comprehensive program for managing hotel room reservations, we'll break 
down the system into key components and describe each in detail. This program will be 
a web-based application with a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionality. 
Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how to design this system:
1. System Overview
Components:
 Frontend: User Interface (UI) for customers and hotel staff
 Backend: Server-side logic, database management, and APIs
 Database: Store data related to users, rooms, bookings, etc.
2. Functional Requirements
Customer Functionality:
 Search for available rooms
 View room details and prices
 Make a reservation
 Cancel a reservation
 View booking history
Hotel Staff Functionality:
 Add, edit, or delete room listings
 Manage bookings (approve, cancel)
 View reservation reports
 Update room availability and prices
3. User Interface Design
Customer Interface:
 Home Page: Search bar for room availability by date, number of guests, etc.
 Room Listings: List of available rooms with filters (price range, room type, amenities)
 Room Details: Detailed view of a selected room (images, description, price, amenities)
 Reservation Form: Form to enter personal details, select room, and payment method
 Booking Confirmation: Page showing booking details and confirmation status
 User Account: View and manage bookings, personal information
Hotel Staff Interface:
 Dashboard: Overview of current bookings, occupancy rate, and recent activity
 Room Management: Interface to add, edit, or remove rooms
 Booking Management: Approve or cancel bookings, view booking details
 Reports: Generate reports on occupancy, revenue, and booking trends
4. Database Design
Tables:
 Users: Store user information (user_id, name, email, password, user_type)
 Rooms: Store room details (room_id, room_type, price, description, amenities, status)
 Bookings: Store booking details (booking_id, user_id, room_id, check_in_date, 
check_out_date, status, payment_info)
 Payments: Store payment information (payment_id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, 
payment_method)
 Availability: Store room availability status (room_id, date, is_available)
5. Backend Architecture
Technologies:
 Server: Node.js/Express.js for handling HTTP requests and business logic
 Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational data management
 Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
 Payment Gateway Integration: Stripe/PayPal for processing payments
APIs:
 Authentication APIs: Register, login, logout
 Room APIs: Get available rooms, get room details, manage rooms
 Booking APIs: Make a booking, cancel a booking, get booking details
 Payment APIs: Process payment, view payment history
 Reporting APIs: Generate and fetch reports
6. Detailed Workflow
User Registration & Login:
1. User registers by providing name, email, and password.
2. System stores hashed password in the database.
3. User logs in with email and password.
4. System validates credentials and issues a JWT token for authenticated sessions.
Room Availability Search:
1. User inputs search criteria (check-in/out dates, number of guests).
2. System queries the database for available rooms.
3. Results are displayed to the user with filtering options.
Making a Reservation:
1. User selects a room and fills in the reservation form.
2. System validates availability and processes payment.
3. Booking details are stored in the database, and availability is updated.
4. Confirmation email is sent to the user.
Managing Bookings (Hotel Staff):
1. Staff logs in and accesses the dashboard.
2. Staff can view pending bookings, approve or cancel them.
3. Staff updates room details and availability as needed.
Reporting:
1. Staff selects report criteria (date range, room type, etc.).
2. System generates the report from the database.
3. Report is displayed in the dashboard or exported as a CSV/PDF file.
7. Security Considerations
 Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and payment details.
 Authentication & Authorization: Ensure only authorized users access certain features.
 Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS 
attacks.
 Secure APIs: Use HTTPS for secure communication between frontend and backend.
8. Deployment
Hosting:
 Deploy the backend server on cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
 Host the frontend on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or as part of the same cloud service.
Scaling:
 Implement load balancing and auto-scaling features to handle traffic spikes.
 Optimize database queries and use caching strategies to improve performance.
By following this detailed design, you can develop a robust and user-friendly hotel room 
reservation system that meets the needs of both customers and hotel staff.
